###Creating a Token
Making a contract using the functions, mapping and conditional statements in solidity.

## Description
This contract have public variables that store the details about the coin (Token Name, Token Abbrv., Total Supply)
 It will have a mapping of addresses to balances along with a mint function that takes two parameters: an address and a value. The function then increases the total supply by that number and increases the balance of the address by that amount and a burn function, which works the opposite of the mint function, as it will destroy tokens. It will take an address and value just like the mint functions. It will then deduct the value from the total supply and from the balance of the address.
